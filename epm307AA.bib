  abstract = {METHODS: Trends in adult (age 15+) daily smoking prevalence from 1996 to 2015 were compiled from three data sources: the New Zealand Census, the New Zealand Health Survey (NZHS), and the Health and Lifestyles Survey (HLS). We compared key features of the surveys (eg, sample size, ethnicity classification), examined composite trends across surveys, and analysed differences between and within surveys over time.
RESULTS: Both the Census and the NZHS show a decline in adult (age 15+) daily smoking over the past 18 years, from 23–25\% in 1996/97, to around 15\% in 2014/15, with broadly consistent findings from the HLS since it began in 2008. However, recent NZHS findings do not suggest substantive reductions in daily smoking prevalence, particularly for Māori and Pacific populations, with 2014/15 rates of 35.5\% and 22.4\% in these populations respectively, and no statistically significant change since 2006/07. NZHS has advantages over the New Zealand Census and the HLS for the purposes of monitoring annual progress towards to the Smokefree 2025 goal.
CONCLUSION: These data collectively suggest that recent declines in smoking prevalence are modest and clearly inadequate for achieving the Smokefree 2025 and interim 2018 goals, particularly for Māori and Pacific peoples. Continuation and improvement of tobacco-related surveillance is crucial for monitoring progress toward the 2025 goal.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews adjusted methods of estimation of attributable risk (AR), that is methods that allow one to obtain estimates of AR while controlling for other factors. Estimability and basic principles of AR estimation are first considered and the rationale for adjusted AR estimators is discussed. Then, adjusted AR estimators are reviewed focusing on cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies. Two inconsistent adjusted estimators are briefly commented upon. Next, adjusted estimators based on stratification, namely the weighted-sum and Mantel-Haenszel (MH) approaches, are reviewed and contrasted. It appears that the weighted-sum approach, which allows for full interaction between exposure and adjustment factors, can be affected by small-sample bias. By contrast, the MH approach, which rests on the assumption of no interaction between exposure and adjustment factors may be misleading if interaction between exposure and adjustment factors is present. Model-based adjusted estimators represent a more general and flexible approach that includes both stratification approaches as special cases and offers intermediate options. Bruzzi et al.'s and Greenland and Drescher's estimators are reviewed and contrasted. Finally, special problems of adjusted estimation are considered, namely estimation from case-cohort data, estimation for risk factors with multiple levels, for multiple risk factors, for recurrent events, estimation of the prevented and preventable fractions, and estimation of the generalized impact fraction. Comments on future directions are presented.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite a major reduction in overall infant mortality, sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) continues to be of concern in New Zealand, as the rate is high by international standards, and is even higher in indigenous Māori. AIM: To identify modifiable risk factors for SUDI.
METHODS: A three-year (1 March 2012–28 February 2015) nationwide case-control study was conducted in New Zealand.
RESULTS: There were 137 SUDI cases, giving a SUDI mortality rate of 0.76/1,000 live births. The rate for Māori was 1.41/1,000, Pacific 1.01/1,000 and non-Māori non-Pacific (predominantly European) 0.50/1,000. The parent(s) of 97\% of the SUDI cases were interviewed. Six hundred and forty-nine controls were selected and 258 (40\%) were interviewed. The two major risk factors for SUDI were: maternal smoking in pregnancy (adjusted OR=6.01, 95\% CI=2.97, 12.15) and bed sharing (aOR=4.96, 95\% CI=2.55, 9.64). There was a significant interaction (p=0.002) between bed sharing and antenatal maternal smoking. Infants exposed to both risk factors had a markedly increased risk of SUDI (aOR=32.8, 95\% CI=11.2, 95.8) compared with infants not exposed to either risk factor. Infants not sharing the parental bedroom were also at increased risk of SUDI (aOR=2.77, 95\% CI=1.45, 5.30). Just 21 cases over the three-year study were not exposed to smoking in pregnancy, bed sharing or front or side sleeping position.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that many of the risk factors that were identified in the original New Zealand Cot Death Study (1987–1989) are still relevant today. The combination of maternal smoking in pregnancy and bed sharing is extremely hazardous for infants. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the SUDI prevention messages are still applicable today and should be reinforced. SUDI mortality could be reduced to just seven p.a. in New Zealand (approximately one in 10,000 live births).},

  abstract = {New Zealand's high mortality rate from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prompted the development of the New Zealand Cot Death Study. A report of the analysis of the data from the first year has been published. This report now gives the major identified risk factors from the full 3 year data set. In this case-control study there were 485 infants who died from SIDS in the post-neonatal age group, and 1800 control infants, who were a representative sample of all hospital births in the study region. Obstetric records were examined and parental interviews were completed in 97.5\% and 86.9\% of subjects, respectively. As expected many risk factors for SIDS were confirmed including: lower socio-economic status, unmarried mother, young mother, younger school-leaving age of mother, younger age of mother at first pregnancy, late attendance at antenatal clinic, non-attendance at antenatal classes, Maori, greater number of previous pregnancies, the further south the domicile, winter, low birthweight, short gestation, male infant and admission to a special care baby unit. In addition, however, we identified four risk factors that are potentially amenable to modification. These were the prone sleeping position of the baby (odds ratio (OR) = 3.70; 95\% confidence interval (Cl) = 2.91, 4.70); bed sharing (OR = 2.70; 95\% Cl = 2.02, 3.62); maternal smoking of 1–9 cigarettes per day (OR = 3.47; 95\% Cl = 2.50, 4.83), 10–19 cigarettes per day (OR = 3.94; 95\% Cl = 2.87, 5.41) or more than 20 cigarettes per day (OR = 5.90; 95\% Cl = 4.20, 8.31); and not breast feeding (OR = 2.39; 95\% Cl = 1.88, 3.04). After controlling for all of the above variables, the relative risks associated with prone sleeping position (OR = 4.84). sharing bed (OR = 2.02), maternal smoking (OR = 1.79) and not breast feeding (OR = 1.89) were still statistically significant. Population-attributable risk calculations suggest that these four risk factors may account for 82\% of deaths from SIDS. The SIDS mortality rate may fall to less than 0.7/1000 live births if all parents stop putting their infants down to sleep in the prone position, do not sleep with their baby, do not smoke, and breast feed their infants.},

  abstract = {Mother-infant bed-sharing has been a common practice for centuries. Understanding the reasons parents choose to bed-share can help tailor safe sleep education. The purpose of this article was to systematically review the international literature on: (1) reasons parents bed-share, (2) the cultural context of bed-sharing, and (3) implications for interventions and future research. The search occurred August-September 2013 via PubMed, CINAHL, and Psyc INFO using the terms: 'infant,' 'sleep,' 'bed shar*,' 'co sleep*,' 'sleep location,' 'sleep practices,' and 'sleep arrangements,' alone or in combination. Google Scholar was searched using: 'bed share,' 'bed sharing,' 'co sleep,' and 'co sleeping.' Inclusion criteria were: (1) referenced bed-sharing with infants 12 months or younger; (2) provided reasons for bed-sharing; and (3) published between 1990 and 2013. Studies were excluded if they focused on disorders such as epilepsy, breathing disorders, or among multi-gestational infants. Narrative synthesis was used to summarize findings. Thirty-four studies met inclusion criteria. The main themes around bed-sharing based on this synthesis included: (1) breastfeeding, (2) comforting, (3) better/more sleep, (4) monitoring, (5) bonding/attachment, (6) environmental, (7) crying, (8) tradition, (9) disagree with danger, and (10) maternal instinct. Findings suggest that future research should examine parents' decision-making process on infant sleep location, including how they weigh personal reasons and sources of advice. Public health interventions should incorporate the particular reasons of the population they are targeting. Clinicians should discuss infant sleep environment with each family, along with their motivations for choosing this environment, and work within that framework to address the safety of the sleep environment.},
